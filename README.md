My masterpiece, gui that allows to add custom id and token to a custom made bot.

Fuck it, i had wrote a big ass text on how to use it and i fucked up and deleted it, figure it out yourself i guess


role id(1-4) is for the roles you want the command to give

Token is the token of the bot you want the script to run into

logs is the channel in which commands will be logged

Req is the rank that is needed to use those commands so that there aren't any random to use it
