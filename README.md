First, you need to input the role id you want the bot to give when using the commands
Here is a guide on how to get them: https://www.itgeared.com/how-to-get-role-id-on-discord/
(Input your roles inside id 1, id 2, id 3, and id 4)


Then, you will want a channel id in which you will want it all to be logged, here is a guide

(Input inside logs

Then, you will want your bot token, for it to actually work at all, as this script will take the bot token and run it all under your own bot, which is why i made this app,

(Input inside Token)

Then, you want to get the req id, so whoever has the role you want may use the command, but no one else (Soon to be added : feature to leave no restrictions if inputted with
a certain keyword), If you know how to get role id, then you are good to go
(Input inside req)

Thats it, you are all set, just need to click on that sweet sweet launch button, if a command prompt opens and dies really quickly, it means something went wrong, check the file
inside of the project folder called discordia.log, should tell you whats wrong, but you can always open an issue about it if you can't figure it out

Enjoy and have a g'day!
